# Getting Started

First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. We've tried to make a stable project and try to fix bugs and add new features continuously. You can help us do more.

Check out the roadmap
We have some functionalities in mind and we have issued them and there is a milestone label available on the issue. If there is a bug or a feature that is not listed in the issues page or there is no one assigned to the issue, feel free to fix/add it! Although it's better to discuss it in the issue or create a new issue for it so there is no confilcting code.

# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork this repository. And that's it! Read the code available and change the part you don't like!
  Ensure that you install all the necessary dependencies.

2. If you're adding a new functionality, start from the branch master. It would be a better practice to create a new branch and work in there.

3. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
    
4. When you're done, submit a pull request and for one of the maintainers to check it out. We would let you know if there is any problem or any changes that          should be considered.

# Tests
We've written tests and you can run them to assure the stability of the code, just try command. If you're adding a new functionality please write a test for it.

# Documentation
Every chunk of code that may be hard to understand has some comments above it. If you write some new code or change some part of the existing code in a way that it would not be functional without changing it's usages, it needs to be documented.
